# NetLink
The purpose of making this was to make a drag and drop package to talk between two computers.
The next thing to do is to make this control things with this, such as motors and lights. 
This more advance version in my head is once you hold a button on one computer a robot will react to that and stop once the button is released.
Basically RC cars but with IP communication.
